    review: "Perfect!  Thatâ€™s the one word that describes the entire experience.  The communication was excellent from the initial planning phase to trip completion. The planned itinerary was great and the execution was spot-on.  The hotels were all excellent choices in good locations.  All of the drivers were on-time, or early, and our guides provided suggestions beyond the planned itinerary which greatly enhanced our memories.  I could compliment every person I dealt with, but Arnaud, our driver/guide in and around Nice, stood out for his expertise and engaging personality. Well done French Side Travel!!"

    review: "French Side Travel arranged our trip from Paris to Normandy and back to Paris with private cars and guides. Everything went very smoothly, 'not a hitch'. Our guides were extremely knowledgeable and spoke beautiful English. The drivers were equally professional. The trip organization and execution could not have been done better. I will use the firm again with great confidence."

    review: "We had a great trip with French Side Travel.  We worked with Frank to plan it out based on our specific needs and he hit all of the marks.  The most important part was the execution.  We worked with Christopher that planned the details and provided a detailed itinerary.  We were most happy with our guides Claire and Rachel that we spent our days with.  Claire is so knowledgeable and loved sharing her knowledge of the Loire Valley.  Rachel was a definite foodie like us and we had an amazing time wandering through the Halles Market.  thank you for a wonderful and worry free trip"

    review: "We just ended a 10 days trip to the French Riviera and Bordeaux with our close friend, French side travel helped us with the trip, coordinated the entire trip from airport pickup to airport departure, working with Elodie in Aix En Provence was just amazing. She is the bomb. Detailed oriented, attention to our needs, tailored the trip to our needs, all the service providers she picked were wonderful, we sure had a memorable trip with our friends, everything was 5 star experiences. Thank you Elodie and French Side Travel."

    review: "We just got back from a fabulous week in Chamonix planned and booked by French Side Travel. Their entire team was great to work with! We made a lot of changes early in the planning stage to our itinerary and really appreciated their patience. Everything went as planned and they did a great job!"

    review: "I had French Side Travel arrange for a 6-day ski trip in the French Alps.  The location they suggested (Courchevel) was so amazing -- the hotel, the town, the resort, the ski guide -- everything was first rate.  Planning next year's trip now."
